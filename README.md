# TheBody
An object-oriented (java) model of the workings of the human body.  

This currently consists of a heart and lungs implementation together with circulatory system components (blood vessels, red blood cells).  

These components can be used to build a circulatory system of any size and shape where the heart transports blood to and from the lungs and the lungs oxygenate the blood.  

The API that this provides has been designed to facilitate further addition of other organs at any position in this circulatory system that can use this blood supply, therefore allowing further work and a complete model of the human body to be built up.
