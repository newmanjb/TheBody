Muscle pairs (as outlined in 11th Dec below) have been added and tested
Nerves + functionality to link components up via nerves has been added and tested
Muscles can be connected to brain or another impulse generator via nerves and their movements controlled
by nerve impulses (tested)
Heart can be connected to brain or another impulse generator via nerves and the beating controlled by nerve
impulses (tested)
TODO -
- Lungs need to be modified to be run by nerve impulses in the same way as the heart has been
- need to use Oxygen in rest of body, as it's only used in Muscle

Muscle, first version, is complete
Tests have been written and all run correctly for muscle.
Still to do from Sept -- need to use Oxygen in rest of body, as it's only used in Muscle
Muscle can now be enhanced so as it can be added in "groups" or "pairs" i.e. when one in the pair contracts it "relaxes"
the other one and vica versa e.g. like biceps and triceps, and in order to stop a muscle from contracting the counteracting
muscle must contract enough to counteract it.

September 25th 2015
----------------------
New "movement" package added.
Muscle + 3 other classes it needs which are CirculatorySystemOxygenTaker, IntegerPercentage and Oxygen added.
IntegerPercentage, CirculatorySystemOxygenTaker and Oxygen have been tested and documented and are done.
Muscle is done and documented but hasn't been tested
Also, Oxygen is only used in the Muscle.  Need to convert the rest of the body to use it instead of ints

Everything in here is tested and works i.e. the circulatory system, particles, red blood cells and all their  movements, the processors, the heart and the lungs etc..

This includes testing from a multithreaded integration-test perspective i.e. using loads of particles and multiple particles in each pipe.

The tests are in the test section.

There is no untested or incomplete code in here.

I could probably stand to get rid of the hibernate functionality though as it doesn't really add anything.  Although it just sits there separately and doesn't affect anything.

So whatever you want to do next it is being built on sound foundations.  Enjoy!!
