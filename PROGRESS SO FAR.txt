Everything in here is tested and works i.e. the circulatory system, particles, red blood cells and all their  movements, the processors, the heart and the lungs etc..

This includes testing from a multithreaded integration-test perspective i.e. using loads of particles and multiple particles in each pipe.

The tests are in the test section.

There is no untested or incomplete code in here.

I could probably stand to get rid of the hibernate functionality though as it doesn't really add anything.  Although it just sits there separately and doesn't affect anything.

So whatever you want to do next it is being built on sound foundations.  Enjoy!!
